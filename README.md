# Dotfiles

My dotfiles to quickly configure my computing setup.

Iâ€™ve been using this setup successfully on a variety of systems, for almost a decade now:

- GNU operating systems (Arch, Manjaro, Ubuntu on WSL2, AmazonLinux, Synology NAS)
- macOS

GNU/Linux distribution checks are done as required to customize behavior and commands.

## Installation

Clone this repository and run `make`.

This will copy all the dotfiles into their appropriate places.

## Uninstallation

From your local working directory for this repo, run

```bash
make uninstall
```
